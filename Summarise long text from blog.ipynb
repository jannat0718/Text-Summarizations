To understand neural networks, we need to break it down and understand the most basic unit of a Neural Network, i. e.  a Perceptron.  A Perceptron is a single layer neural network that is used to classify linear data.  It has 4 important components:  The basic logic behind a Perceptron is as follows: The inputs (x) received from the input layer are multiplied with their assigned weights w. \\xa0 The multiplied values are then added to form the Weighted Sum.  The weighted sum of the inputs and their respective weights are then applied to a relevant Activation Function.  The activation function maps the input to the respective output.  Why do we have to assign weights to each input?  Once an input variable is fed to the network, a randomly chosen value is assigned as the weight of that input.  The weight of each input data point indicates how important that input is in predicting the outcome.  The bias parameter, on the other hand, allows you to adjust the activation function curve in such a way that a precise output is achieved.  Once the inputs are assigned some weight, the product of the respective input and weight is taken.  Adding all these products gives us the Weighted Sum.  This is done by the summation function.  The main aim of the activation functions is to map the weighted sum to the output.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":13}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["len(chunks[1].split(' '))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"J3VU4rkz-09b","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1648714927564,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":32,"user":{"displayName":"Jannatul Ferdous","userId":"17288488832087059331"}},"outputId":"55ab1276-4b4b-4c43-f99d-e263acfcd6a7"},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["500"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":14}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["##Summmarize chunks\n","res=summarizer(chunks,max_length=120,min_length=30,do_sample=False)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"mgXbF3YHAyFh","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1648715100073,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":55042,"user":{"displayName":"Jannatul Ferdous","userId":"17288488832087059331"}},"outputId":"fbc0cfa9-393e-4d1f-b311-8510ebc9e3aa"},"execution_count":17,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Your max_length is set to 120, but you input_length is only 118.

It uses this vast amount of data to identify possible fraudulent activities among other reasons . The company has been relying on Deep Learning & Machine Learning technology for around 10 years . A simple linear model is capable of consuming around 20 variables but with Deep Learning technology one can run thousands of data points .  The process begins with processing and transforming the input in such a way that it can be easily processed . As the input is passed from the input layer to the hidden layer, an initial random weight is assigned to each input . An activated perceptron is used to transmit data to the next layer . At the output layer, a probability is derived which decides whether the data belongs to class A or class B .
